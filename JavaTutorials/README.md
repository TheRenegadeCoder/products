### Naming Conventions ###

Each tutorial is organized into a folder by difficulty level. For instance, the beginner series is located in the Basics folder. Within every folder, each tutorial is given an episode number. For example, `000-introduction-to-java` would be the very first tutorial. Following the numeric pattern, a title is given to the tutorial. It should closely match the same tutorial name from the website.
